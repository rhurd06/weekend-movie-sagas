# Project Name

Weekend Movie Sagas

## Description

Our client has movie and genre database currently set up but wants to add some features to it. To start they would like an add movie feature to allow users to add more movies to the list. The inputs that should be included are: title, poster url, description and a dropdown menu for genres. In addition the client would like the ability for users to view all of the information on the click of a movie. That click should bring the user to a page that would show all genres the movie falls in, the description, poster and title.

You'll need to create the database as included in the file and get some practice using SQL in the second piece of this assignment by answering a few questions.

The programs you'll need are all included once you've done your npm install.
To get the site up in your browser use npm run server and npm run client in separate terminal windows.
