# Project Name

Weekend Movie Sagas

## Description

Our client has movie and genre database currently set up but wants to add some features to it. To start they would like an add movie feature to allow users to add more movies to the list. The inputs that should be included are: title, poster url, description and a dropdown menu for genres. In addition the client would like the ability for users to view all of the information on the click of a movie. That click should bring the user to a page that would show all genres the movie falls in, the description, poster and title.

## Technologies used:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL
- React.js
- Redux.js
- Redux-Saga.js

## To Begin

1. Create the database named saga_movies_weekend
2. The table names, parameters, and sample values are provided in the database.sql file.
3. If it's not already running, make sure to start postgres by using brew services start posgresql in the terminal
4. Next run an npm install to retrieve all dependencies
5. Now your ready to start your server; npm run server
6. Open a second terminal to start your client; npm run client. This will open up a new tab in your default browser.
